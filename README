This is an algorithm library maintained and written by myself. It contains easy to use efficient implementations of various general use / particular algorihtms and data structures.
I've done some testing on my part, but don't get too upset if they don't work as expected. Also if you have a particular request for some algoritm or data structure that is not yet there, you can write to me :)
